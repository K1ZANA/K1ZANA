# Nexus/Kizana´s Co-Owner application

Hey! I´m Kizana, i´m a 14 year old german boy in 7th Class.


# Why am i applying?

I was a Co-Owner before, and i really really liked supporting the server, and managing it.

## My strenghts:

I can speak English and German very well, i know how to manage servers.
I also lead a small project called "Cult of X", that is making puzzles for youtubers who join the project as content creators. (This isnt a advertising btw, since the project cant really be found under that name anyways.)

## My weaknesses:

I am very easily irritable, and can't really handle some situations, which is limited because I can calm down very easily.

## My online-times

Unfortunately, these can vary greatly, but the standard times are these:

Monday:

7:00 PM

Tuesday:

1:30 PM

Wednesday:

2:00 PM

Thursday:

2:00 PM

Fridays:

2:00 PM

Weekend:

24 H

## My experiences:

I'm generally very experienced because I've been on this server for a very long time, and generally working with a team for a very long time.

## Which languages do I speak?

*I speak*:

German `100%`
English `95%`
Japanese `5%`


## Application End

This was the application! I spent some time on it, and i hope it gets accepted!
